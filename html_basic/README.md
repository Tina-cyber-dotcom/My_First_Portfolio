# My First Portfolio

This project is part of my journey to learn web development from scratch.  
It contains a basic HTML file that is W3C-compliant and has no external libraries.

- `html_basic/base_index.html`: A valid HTML5 file with proper DOCTYPE, head, and body structure.

## Technologies Used

- HTML only (no CSS or JavaScript yet)
- No external libraries or frameworks

## Validation

- HTML validated using the official W3C Validator: [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/)
